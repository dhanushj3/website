            <h1>Traffic Management</h1>
            <p>Traffic management refers to the practice of controlling and regulating the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on roadways and transportation networks to ensure safety, efficiency, and order. It involves a combination of policies, strategies, and technologies aimed at optimizing the flow of traffic, reducing congestion, and minimizing the risks of accidents and delays. Effective traffic management is crucial in urban areas and along major transportation corridors, where the volume of vehicles and pedestrians can be high and diverse.
